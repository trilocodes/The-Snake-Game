# Snake Game in Python using Turtle

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python's Turtle graphics library. The goal of the game is to navigate the snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid collisions with the walls and itself.

## Features

- **Simple and intuitive gameplay**: Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
- **Scoring system**: Track your score as the snake eats more food and grows longer and keep track of the high score.
- **Game over detection**: The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.
- **Restart functionality**: Restart the game automatically without closing the application.
